# üê¶ Hadeda

Modern Hypermedia Driven Application (HDA) Stack. Heavily inspired by BETH stack and the thoughts of HTMX, and this video [From React To HTMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIzwyyHolRs)

The goal is to achieve something akin to Ruby on Rails' level of productivity and DX.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve htmx typesafety
- [ ] Develop plugin system
- [ ] glob import generation of barrel files for models and conntrollers

## Features

- [x] Flexibility on DB choice (due to prisma)
- [x] typesafe
- [x] hot reload

## Development

```bash
--- Getting Started
# Copy .env file and fill out the values
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Create a db
bun run db:push

# Run the development server
bun dev

--- Other scripts

# Format schema and code
bun fmt

--- DB Scripts

# Studio
bun run db:studio

# Migrations
bunx prisma migrate dev --name "init" --preview-feature

# Schema push
bun run db:push
```

## Structure

- src - Any file that associate with development of Elysia server.
  - components - Reusable JSX components
  - controllers - Instances which encapsulate multiple endpoints
  - models - Data Type Objects (DTOs) for Elysia instance
  - services - Composed of various plugins to be used as a Service Locator
  - utils - Utility functions
  - index.ts - Entry point for your Elysia server, ideal place for setting global plugin
  - types.d.ts - Shared TypeScript type
